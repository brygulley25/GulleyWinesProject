			<h2>Our Wine Making Process</h2>
			<img src="/images/about us wine pic.jpg" alt="Gulley Wine making process">
			<p>At Gulley Wine, we believe that the best wines are made in the vineyard. Our winemakers work closely with our grape growers to ensure that every vine is tended to with care and attention to detail. Once the grapes are harvested, they are gently pressed and the juice is aged in oak barrels to create the rich, complex flavors that our wines are known for.</p>
